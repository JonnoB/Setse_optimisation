#'@param g An igraph object of the network that is going to be turned into a spring embedding.
#'@param force a character string. The node attribute that contains the force information for the network.
#'@param distance a character string. The edge attribute that contains the distance of the edge.
#'@param mass a character string. the node attribute that contains the mass of the nodes.
