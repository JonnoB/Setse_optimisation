#' Create balanced blocks
#' 
#' Separates the network into a series of bi-connected components that can be solved separately. 
#' Solving smaller subgraphs using the bi-connected component method reduces the risk of network divergence.
#' 
#' When networks are separated into the bi-connected subgraphs or blocks. The overall network balance needs to be maintained. 
#' \code{create_balanced_blocks} maintains the balance by summing the net force across the all the nodes that are being removed from
#' the subgraph. Therefore a node that is an articulation point has a force value equal to the total of all the nodes on the adjacent
#' bi-connected component.
#' 
#' @param g An igraph object. The network for which embeddings will be found
#' @param force A character vector. The name of the node attribute that is the force exerted by the nodes
#' @param flow A character vector. The name of the edge attribute that contains the flow over each edge
#' @return A list containing all the bi connected component where each component is balanced to have a net force of 0.
