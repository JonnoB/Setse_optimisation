# Spring Embeddings

These are the functions used to make a spring system in equillibrium out of a balanced flow network.
The functions allow a 2d network to be converted into a 3D network using a simple physics model.

The system can be used on an unbalanced network and also a non-flow network.

* This project is still on-going work. 
* The code here will be turned into a package before publication.
