#' Calculate line tension and strain
#' 
#' This function calculates the line  tension and strain characteristics for the edges in a graph
#' 
#' Whilst the height_embeddings_df contains the elevation of the SETS alogirthm this function produces a data frame that contains the Tension
#' and Strain. The dataframe that is returned contains a substantial amount of line information so reducing the number of variables may be
#' necessary if the data frame will be merged with previously generated data as there could be multiple columns of the same value.
#' 
#' 
#' @param g An igraph object of the network.
#' @param height_embeddings_df A data frame. This is the results of Create_stabilised_blocks or Find_network_balance
#' @param distance A character string. The name of the edge attribute that contains the distance between two nodes. The default is "distance"
#' @param capcity A character string. The name of the edge attribute that contains the flow capacity of the edge between two nodes. 
#' @param flow A character string. The name of the edge attribute that contains the flow between the two nodes at the end of the edge. The default is "power_flow".
#' @param edge_name   A character string. The name of the edge attribute that contains the edge name. The default is "edge_name".
#' @param k A character string. The name of the edge attribute that contains the sping coefficient
#' @return The function returns a data frame of 11 columns. These columns are the edge name, the alpha level, the line load (aka the inverse of alpha), 
#' the change in elevation, The final distance between the two nodes (the hypotenuse of the orignal distance and the vertical distance), 
#' the spring constant k, the edge tension, the edge strain, the percentile edge strain, the mean elevation and the total flow.
