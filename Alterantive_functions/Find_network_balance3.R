#' Find the network balance
#' 
#' This simulates the dynamics of the network for a set number of iterations or until convergence which ever is the sooner.
#' 
#' This function is often used in conjunction with \code{Create_stabilised_blocks} and \code{create_balanced_blocks}
#' 
#' @param g An igraph object
#' @param force A character string. This is the node attribute that contains the force the nodes exert on the network.
#' @param flow A character string. This is the edge attribute that is the power flow on the edges.
#' @param capacity A character string. This is the edge attribute that is the flow limit of the edges.
#' @param distance A character string. The edge attribute that contains the original/horizontal distance between nodes.
#' @param edge_name A character string. This is the edge attribute that contains the edge_name of the edges.
#' @param tstep A numeric. The time interval used to iterate through the network dynamics.
#' @param mass A numeric. This is the mass constant of the nodes in normalised networks this is set to 1.
#' @param maxIter An integer. The maximum number of iterations before stopping. Larger networks usually need more iterations.
#' @param frctmultiplier A numeric. This sets the multiplier of friction. Only use if you want to be annoyed and confused
#' @param tol A numeric. The tolerance factor for early stopping.
#' @param verbose Logical. This value sets whether messages generated during the process are supressed or not.
#' @param two_node_solution Logical. The 
#' 
#' @return A data frame with the height embeddings of the network
