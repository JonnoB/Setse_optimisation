#' Find stabil system
#' 
#' Runs the SETSe model to find the convergence of the system.
#' @param node_status A data frame The current dynamics and forces experienced by the node a data frame.
#' @param ten_mat A data frame The current dynamics and forces experienced by the node a data frame.
#' @param non_empty_matrix A numeric matrix. contains the index of the non-empty cells in the adjacency matrix. see details.
#' @param kvect A numeric vector of the spring stiffnesses
#' @param dvect A numeric vector of the initial distances between the nodes
#' @param mass A numeric. This is the mass constant of the nodes in normalised networks this is set to 1.
#' @param tstep A numeric value. The time step, measured in seconds, that will be used to calculate the new dynamic state
#' @param max_iter An integer. The maximum number of iterations before stopping. Larger networks usually need more iterations.
#' @param coef_drag A numeric value. Used to set a multiplier on the friction value. Generally leave this alone..s.
#' @param tol A numeric. The tolerance factor for early stopping.
#' @param sparse Logical. Whether or not the function should be run using sparse matrices. must match the actual matrix, this could prob be automated
#' @export
#' 
#' @details The non_empty matrix contains the row, column position and absolute index and transpose index of the edges in the matrix
#' This means vectors can be used for most operations greatly reducing the amount of memory required and 
#' providing a modest speed increase. The non_empty_matrix is produced by the 'Prepare_data_for_find_network_balance' function.
#'
# Strips out all pre processing to make it as efficient and simple as possible
